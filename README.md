<h1>A* Visual with 'data mode'</h1>
<h3> About: </h3>
<p> 
I made this quick app to pair with my Data Science final presentation about Adjacency Matrices and Graph-based Search Algorithms.
<br>Many people have made path-finding visualizations, but I thought it would be interesting to preserve information about the decisions made before calculating the final path.
<br>After you have finished running A* toggle into 'data mode' and click on some cells to see what I mean.
<br>It could use some finishing touches but the functionality is there.
